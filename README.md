# EventEaseApp

This is a project to complete the Microsoft Blazor for Front-End Development course in Coursera.
I have created, debugged, and enhanced components for the EventEase app using Microsoft Copilot.

Microsoft Copilot assisted me in each step of the development process:

1. Setting up the Blazor project
2. Creating the Pages, Components, Models and Services
3. Generating mock data
4. Implementing and debugging the routing functionality
5. Optimizing the app for performance like virtualizing the list of events
6. Addressing issues like input validation and routing errors
